# codeforireland-water-pwa
Frontend progressive web app for Code for Ireland Transparent Water project.

This is a minimal progressive web app with a map interface that calls the water data via XHR. 

# Back end

The async function getData handles the data call.

# Installation

Needs to be on an SSL webserver, and you'll need to modify the manifest.json file to reflect its location if you don't choose the same directory name. Otherwise no installation other than uploading the files.

# UI

Could do with some work!
